# Interactive Generative Art Gallery

Welcome to the **Interactive Generative Art Gallery** – a creative web application that showcases generative art, data visualizations, and interactive tools for manipulating images and art. This project demonstrates how to combine Python, Flask, and various libraries to build an engaging digital art gallery.

## Project Overview

The Interactive Generative Art Gallery features:

- **Generative Art Pieces:** Randomly generated artworks created using Python’s object-oriented programming, loops, and conditionals.
- **Data-Driven Visualizations:** Creative visual representations of data (e.g., weather data) using Matplotlib and Pandas.
- **Image Manipulation:** A tool (Image Lab) that allows users to upload images and apply a glitch effect.
- **Interactive Art Canvas:** An HTML5 canvas where users can click to generate colorful, random shapes.
- **(Optional) Audio Manipulation & Machine Learning:** Additional features can include audio processing (with PyDub) and bonus ML features (e.g., art caption generation or style transfer).

## Features

- **Generative Art Engine:** Uses a custom `NeuroCanvas` class to create cyberpunk-style artwork.
- **Data Visualization:** Displays creative data visualizations with Matplotlib.
- **Image Lab:** Allows users to upload an image and apply a glitch effect using Pillow.
- **Interactive Canvas:** Lets users draw by clicking on a canvas, which generates random colored circles.
- **Responsive Web Design:** All pages include inline CSS for a consistent look and feel.
- **Flask Web App:** Hosts all these interactive features and serves as the project's backend.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+**  
- **Git** (optional, for cloning the repository)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository or Download the ZIP:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/interactive-generative-art-gallery.git
   cd interactive-generative-art-gallery
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

   - On **Windows:**
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate.bat
     ```
   - On **macOS/Linux:**
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install Dependencies:**
   Install the required Python packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install flask pillow matplotlib pandas numpy
   ```
   If you plan to use audio processing features, you may also need:
   ```bash
   pip install pydub
   ```
   > **Note:** For audio processing, ensure you have [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) installed on your system.

## Running the Application

1. **Ensure your virtual environment is activated.**
2. **Run the Flask application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
3. **Open your browser and navigate to:**
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```
   You will see the homepage with links to the Gallery, DataViz, ImageLab, and Interactive Art pages.

```

- **app.py:** Main Flask application with all route definitions.
- **templates/**: Contains all HTML templates with inline CSS.
- **static/js/**: Contains JavaScript files for interactive functionality.
- **static/uploads/**: Directory for storing user-uploaded images and audio files.

## Troubleshooting

- **Template Not Found Error (e.g., image-lab.html):**  
  Ensure that all HTML template files (e.g., `image-lab.html`) are placed in the `templates/` folder and named exactly as referenced.

- **Cyberpunk Art Generation Error:**  
  If you encounter an error related to `_draw_data_stream`, make sure that the call to `self._draw_data_stream(color)` has been removed from the `generate_cyberpunk()` method in `app.py`.

- **404 Errors for Static Files:**  
  Double-check your directory structure. If you see a 404 for `/static/css/styles.css`, verify that your external CSS file exists and that your routes or inline styles are being used instead.

- **Virtual Environment Issues:**  
  Ensure you activate the virtual environment correctly before installing dependencies and running the app.

## Future Enhancements

- **Audio Processing:** Add more advanced audio manipulation using PyDub and additional filters.
- **Machine Learning:** Integrate style transfer or art caption generation using TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- **User Interaction:** Implement user authentication, saved galleries, or interactive art customization tools.
